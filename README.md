# Portfolio
This project is another go at a personal portfolio page to showcase my projects and allow users to learn more about me.

## Motivation
I want to continue to build on my skills on the front end. This is a bit of a challenge at the moment since my knowledge and experience are limited, and I have felt more drawn to back end development.

## Technologies
Built in Visual Studio Code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
