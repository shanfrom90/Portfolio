        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>I recently completed We Can Code It's full stack bootcamp in April 2021. I decided to enter the field of
                software development because I enjoy analyzing and solving problems, and working in a collaborative
                environment to drive innovative solutions that improve our daily lives. </p>
            <p> Professionally, I have extensive experience working for small businesses and nonprofits where I've
                started out in entry level positions and advanced within organizations bringing my enthusiasm, attention
                to detail, and positive attitude to my work. I'm excited to combine my skills, curiousity, and
                commitment to grow as a developer. Long term, I am interested in mentoring opportunites for other folks
                looking to enter this field. </p>
            <p>In my free time, you can find me playing League of Legends with my younger sister Catie, hiking in the
                Metroparks and CVNP, cooking up delicious vegetarian food, and keeping up with my adopted cat, Freddie.
